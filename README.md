# MIPSelBinaries
Useful static binaries compiled for MIPSel+uClibc, specifically made these for my WRT54GS router but will likely work elsewhere.

None of this is my original code, but other people's projects ported to MIPSel. I have had to modify some of the code. For the texor editor, I modified it to use the Ins key for options rather than the the Ctrl key because I experienced issues with the Ctrl key. For gkermit, I recommend actually renaming it to "kermit" and adding to the path when moved to your device, because then it can automatically be picked by the ckermit and you will not need to place gkermit in a receiving state prior to sending a file.
